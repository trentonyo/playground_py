features to finish (in read order on GUI):

- link everything to Generate button
- provide some kind of feedback while simulations are running

- create "Learn from that" feature that synapses things from the output log
--- maybe the output log should be a listbox then? so you can select ones to learn from? or perhaps it would open a new window!
- fix up "<params>" key you included hardcoded, it is not used and needs to be filtered out of the simulations
- create output save feature



QA:

x	try loading a file other than json
x	try using a shit load of special characters
x	try using negatives in the inputs
x	try using letters in the number inputs
x	try hitting generate without a sim type selected
